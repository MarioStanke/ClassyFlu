DESCRIPTION: hmmClassify.pl is a tool to classify influenza A HA-gene sequences based on hidden markov profiles
	     There are different options (HMM profile database)
		
REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
	- PERL
	- HMMER


SYNOPSIS:

hmmClassify.pl --in input.fa --out output

	input.fa is an unaligned sequence file in FASTA format
	output is the name one can choose for the output file


OPTIONS:

    	--help  output this help message
    	--db	specifying the hmm database to use (by default the program uses the file hmmClassifydb_new)
	--lic	outputs the WARRANTY
	                       
                 
OUTPUT:	
	text file with two rows per input sequence: 
	- sequence name; length of the sequence, highest score, predicted model (tab-delimited) if a match was found
	- sequence name; "No Hit against one of the models." if no match was found
	- sequence name; "Sequence si to short for classification.", if the input sequence is to short.
